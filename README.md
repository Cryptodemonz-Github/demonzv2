# CRYPTODEMONZ V2

This version includes new feature called "Sacrifice". The logic is following:
User sends exactly 3 V1 tokens to contract, then contract will burn them and will mint
exactly 1 V2 token in exchange. 

Also this version will be deployed on polygon POS or Plasma bridge, to avoid abusing gas fees.

For testing, `test/Demonzv2_test.js` contains all important checks, require statements are 
obvi skipped. For testing there is mock Demonzv1 in `/mock` directory. 

So far, no issues, development will continue smoothly. 

# LAUNCH DATE

Official launch date is **September 25th at 8am PDT**, most likely not subjected to any postponing.
